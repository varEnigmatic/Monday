		<li>Linux</li>
		<p>Today we will talk about the Linux kernel, and I use Ubuntu for my OS.</p>
		<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman developed the beginnings of the GNU project, which had a major role in the creation of the Gnu C compiler.</p>
		<p>Linus Torvalds releases Linux version 0.01 in 1991 as a student (September). At this moment Linux only supported the AT hard disks.</p>
		<p>Today, 80% of web servers are running Linux! Up to some of the top development organizations.</p>
		<p>This open source, so that the public can view the code. Always check to see if you can edit.</p>
