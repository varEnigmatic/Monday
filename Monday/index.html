	<h1>MONDAY</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Getting Started</li>
			<p>Today we will talk about the Linux kernel, and I use Ubuntu for my OS.</p>
			<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman developed the beginnings of the GNU project, which had a major role in the creation of the Gnu C compiler.</p>
			<p>Linus Torvalds releases Linux version 0.01 in 1991 as a student (September). At this moment Linux only supported the AT hard disks.</p>
			<p>Today, 80% of web servers are running Linux! Up to some of the top development organizations.</p>
			<p>This open source, so that the public can view the code. Always check to see if you can edit.</p>
			<p>Different companies make different distrobutions (distros).</p>
		<li>Advantages</li> <!--here is where we start to use ordered list and unorderd list. This will be the start to a great UI that the user can interact with or observe.-->
			<ul>
				<li>Linux is free.</li>
				<li>The stability of Linux.</li>
				<li>Linux is easy to install, so please erase your windows' OS.</li>
				<li>Linux works on any platform.</li>
				<li>Linux has less security risks.</li>
				<li>Choice between many different distros.</li>
				<li>Speed of OS is generally constant.</li>
				<li>Most of the software is free/open source</li>

			</ul>
		<li>Disadvantages</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Learning Linux can sometimes be hard and fustrating. Luckily we have, "Google!"</li>
				<li>Linux also runs in it's "own lane," meaning you may have to dig a little to find compatiable software. SEARCH!</li>
				<li>Also there is not a lot of technical support for Linux. So here again, Google, is your friend!</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Companies that use Linux</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Google</li>
				<li>McDonalds</li>
